# About Me

I can be referred to as Shay or Xueyi 雪昳.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) ane spent three years working as a software engineer in the Internal Tools Team at [TP-Link](https://www.tp-link.com/us/). Starting in September 2024, I will be pursuing my Master's degree in [Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE)]((https://www.hcde.washington.edu/)) at the University of Washington.

My expertise lies in front-end development, UX design, and full-stack development. With 2+ years of full-time experience in front-end development, I specialize in building enterprise-level web systems and desktop applications using React. 

I place high value on both development and user experiences. What I'm passionate about is optimizing user flows and designing elegant interactions amid complex and even volving requirements. I also enjoy keeping development neat by building well-structured software based on design patterns.
